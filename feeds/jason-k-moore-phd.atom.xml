define the ultimate performance of many industrial components and products.
Surface micro-structures, when carefully designed, can alter the optical,
biological, tribological, and thermal properties of the original surfaces. The
bottleneck of applying this new technology to commercial products is
manufacturing efficiency. This talk demonstrates one example of using a novel
vibration-assisted machining method for fast creation of periodic
micro/nano-gratings for structural coloration. When the tool vibration is
coupled with a constant cutting velocity, periodic cusps can be generated due
to the machining marks. The periodic vibration-induced ripples can be precisely
controlled in terms of spacing by changing the nominal cutting velocity. These
periodic ripples, whose wavelength is in the visible spectrum, can introduce
iridescent colors. The device design, theoretical analysis, experimental
results, and potential applications of the process will be covered in this talk
to demonstrate structural coloration of metals by direct machining.&lt;/p&gt;

Many of us went into this field in pursuit of the dream of using our skills and training to help improve the lives of others. Unfortunately, through the pressures of career advancement we find ourselves creating and publishing work that will be read by a handful (sometimes fewer) of others. While practicing open engineering won't guarantee that more people will read your work, it does remove many of the barriers to access that make it difficult for millions of people around the world to obtain and engage with the engineering knowledge that is so often locked away behind the paywalls employed by some of the biggest academic publishers. With the availability of modern tools, it is easier than ever to make available not only the final, polished product of the engineering research or design process, but also the data, code, solid models, or any other artifacts produced along the way. By making the full scope of our work available, we have the opportunity to see our work replicated, expanded upon, or even driven in new directions we hadn't conceived. Through these mechanisms, the impact of our work is magnified. To realize these benefits, it may be necessary to re-examine the reward structures which drive our career advancement and in some cases, restructure the role of the publicly funded research institution in society.&lt;/p&gt;

severe lumbar pain. There is also a significant incidence of herniated
intervertebral disc (IVD) in astronauts, especially in the first year after
return to Earth. The pathogenesis of back pain during and after spaceflight is
currently unknown. Our current investigation aims to understand this higher
incidence of herniated IVDs and back pain. Studies incorporate pre- and
post-flight imaging, functional tests, and pain questionnaires of International
Space Station (ISS) crew members to ascertain mechanisms of back pain as well
as degeneration and injury to spinal structures. Presently six out of 12 ISS
crew members have completed all pre- and post-flight testing. Preliminary
results to date document: 1) decreased functional back-muscle extensor test
(Biering-SÃ¸rensen test time), 2) decreased cervical and lumbar muscle
functional cross-sectional areas with partial recovery by R+45 (only 21% in
neck), 3) increased spine stiffness in flexion, 4) increased spine
straightening, 5) decreased quality of vertebral bodies (anterior wedging and
endplate irregularities), 6) variable water content changes and 7) no
significant changes to disc height and lumbar length. Our results for
morphological, biochemical, metabolic, and fluoroscopic kinematics of the spine
may aid development of countermeasures to reduce back pain and decrease the
incidence of herniated IVDs post-flight. Countermeasures proposed in-flight
should include integrated cardiovascular and musculoskeletal exercises to
reproduce normal, daily Earth-like stresses. Our long-term objectives are to:
1) promote crew health and well-being inflight, 2) optimize post-flight
rehabilitation and translate our findings for Earth Benefit. Supported by NASA

terms of reduced energy requirements or increased design flexibility. However,
the body of knowledge lacks the design consideration of such components to

process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;OSM folded structures are promising topological entities that can be folded
from a flat metal sheet to complex 3-dimensional geometrically constrained
structures. It can offer a reduced demand on the manufacturing and design
resources such as energy, heavy machinery, and complex die design. In addition,
the OSM structures can exploit materials with high strength-to-weight ratios
such as aluminum and stainless steel. Despite its potential, there is a lack in
the understanding of the parameters affecting the topological
re-configurability and load bearing capabilities for full scale OSM structures.
Specifically, the folding performance through the thickness of metal materials
with focus on failure mechanism along the fold lines. The technique of
combining folding structures and metal materials poses challenges that require
further investigation. This talk discusses the extension of the Origami
technique to the fold forming of sheet metal products represented in modeling
