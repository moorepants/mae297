Emerging fabrication process for mechanical structures can offer advantages in
terms of reduced energy requirements or increased design flexibility. However,
the body of knowledge lacks the design consideration of such components to
optimize the final part's characteristics. Researchers have established best
practices and design considerations for traditional manufacturing processes to
reduce the product cycle and increase the efficiency and quality of final
components. This talk will discuss the implementation of design-for
manufacturing approach for Origami sheet metal (OSM) folding fabrication
process.

OSM folded structures are promising topological entities that can be folded
from a flat metal sheet to complex 3-dimensional geometrically constrained
structures. It can offer a reduced demand on the manufacturing and design
resources such as energy, heavy machinery, and complex die design. In addition,
the OSM structures can exploit materials with high strength-to-weight ratios
such as aluminum and stainless steel. Despite its potential, there is a lack in
the understanding of the parameters affecting the topological
re-configurability and load bearing capabilities for full scale OSM structures.
Specifically, the folding performance through the thickness of metal materials
with focus on failure mechanism along the fold lines. The technique of
combining folding structures and metal materials poses challenges that require
further investigation. This talk discusses the extension of the Origami
technique to the fold forming of sheet metal products represented in modeling
approach and design considerations for the topological variations, the
geometrical validity, and mechanical performance analysis.
