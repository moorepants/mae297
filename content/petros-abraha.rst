Surface hardening is a process that includes a wide variety of techniques used
to improve the wear resistance of metallic parts without affecting the softer,
tough interior bulk material. Hardened metals are usually more brittle than
softer metals, there fore, hardening metals throughout the surface and bulk, is
not always a suitable choice of treatment for parts subject to various kinds of
stresses. In such circumstances, case-hardening can provide a better solution
against fracture and adequate wear resistance. There are several methods of
surface hardening techniques: flame hardening and induction heating; and
diffusion methods such as carburizing and nitriding. The present standard
industrial practice of nitriding uses high power DC glow discharge nitriding in
which plasma is produced between the anode (work material) and the cathode.
Here, I will detail plasma nitriding that uses low power electron beam excited
plasma in which the neutral particles play a major role in nitriding the work
material. A glimpse of a new plasma nitriding equipment developed recently will
also be discussed.
