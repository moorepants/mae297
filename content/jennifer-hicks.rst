Understanding the interactions between robotic systems and the human's complex
musculoskeletal system is a key bottleneck in designing effective assistive
devices. OpenSim is free and open source software for modeling neural and
musculoskeletal structures and predicting and analyzing movement. We are using
the software to predict the effects of assistive devices on human performance
in tasks such as load carriage, running, and jumping.  We have discovered that
passive assistive devices have the potential to markedly increase jump
performance. These results were generated using a dynamic optimization that
simultaneously optimized human performance and device design. We have also used
simulations to develop a set of design principles for using assistive devices
to reduce the metabolic cost of running and walking with a heavy load. OpenSim
is more than a software packageâ€”it has also become a diverse and vibrant
community of researchers, teachers, and clinicians who use the software for a
wide range of applications from improving treatment for children with cerebral
palsy to designing exercises to prevent bone and muscle loss during
spaceflight. This talk will provide an introduction to the OpenSim project and
highlight several research applications where we are using the software to
study human-device interaction and aid assistive device design.

Biography

Dr. Hicks is a Senior Research Engineer in the Bioengineering Department at
Stanford University. She serves as the Associate Director of the National
Center for Simulation in Rehabilitation Research and the Director of Data
Science for the Mobilize Center. Her research uses biomechanical modeling,
along with machine learning methods, to predict the effects of surgery,
devices, and other interventions on human movement.
