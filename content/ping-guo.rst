Micro-structured surfaces are assuming an ever-increasing role since they
define the ultimate performance of many industrial components and products.
Surface micro-structures, when carefully designed, can alter the optical,
biological, tribological, and thermal properties of the original surfaces. The
bottleneck of applying this new technology to commercial products is
manufacturing efficiency. This talk demonstrates one example of using a novel
vibration-assisted machining method for fast creation of periodic
micro/nano-gratings for structural coloration. When the tool vibration is
coupled with a constant cutting velocity, periodic cusps can be generated due
to the machining marks. The periodic vibration-induced ripples can be precisely
controlled in terms of spacing by changing the nominal cutting velocity. These
periodic ripples, whose wavelength is in the visible spectrum, can introduce
iridescent colors. The device design, theoretical analysis, experimental
results, and potential applications of the process will be covered in this talk
to demonstrate structural coloration of metals by direct machining.

Biography
=========

Dr. GUO Ping received his B.S. degree in Automotive Engineering from Tsinghua
University in 2009. He received his Ph.D. degree in Mechanical Engineering
under the advisory of Dr. Kornel F. Ehmann from Northwestern University in
2014. He then joined the Department of Mechanical and Automation Engineering at
the Chinese University of Hong Kong as an assistant professor starting in
August, 2014. His research interests center on the paradigm of
micro-manufacturing, including surface texturing, process micro-mechanics,
miniature machine tools, micro-additive manufacturing, etc.
