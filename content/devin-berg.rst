As engineering researchers and scholars, we hope to have an impact on the world
through our work. Many of us went into this field in pursuit of the dream of
using our skills and training to help improve the lives of others.
Unfortunately, through the pressures of career advancement we find ourselves
creating and publishing work that will be read by a handful (sometimes fewer)
of others. While practicing open engineering won't guarantee that more people
will read your work, it does remove many of the barriers to access that make it
difficult for millions of people around the world to obtain and engage with the
engineering knowledge that is so often locked away behind the paywalls employed
by some of the biggest academic publishers. With the availability of modern
tools, it is easier than ever to make available not only the final, polished
product of the engineering research or design process, but also the data, code,
solid models, or any other artifacts produced along the way. By making the full
scope of our work available, we have the opportunity to see our work
replicated, expanded upon, or even driven in new directions we hadn't
conceived. Through these mechanisms, the impact of our work is magnified. To
realize these benefits, it may be necessary to re-examine the reward structures
which drive our career advancement and in some cases, restructure the role of
the publicly funded research institution in society.

===

Dr. Berg is an Associate Professor and Program Director of the Mechanical
Engineering program at the University of Wisconsin-Stout. He is passionate
about finding ways in which we can broaden the impact of engineering design and
development and make the products of engineering scholarship as openly
accessible as possible. In pursuit of these goals he founded `The Journal of
Open Engineering <http://www.tjoe.org/>`_, an experiment in fully open
engineering publishing, and `engrXiv <http://www.engrxiv.org/>`_, an eprint
server for the engineering field.
