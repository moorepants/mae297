Ralf Hotchkiss will track the design of the Whirlwind Wheelchair from its
beginning thirty years ago to the present and on into the future. From the
first design breakthroughs of barefoot blacksmiths to the high tech testing and
manufacturing methods of today, surprise breakthroughs in basic wheelchair
design have come from the backyard inventors of some forty developing
countries. These inventors form the Whirlwind Network of wheelchair riders and
designers. Their goal is not only to make wheelchairs available in the poorest
of countries; it is to radically improve the durability and rough-ground
mobility so that wheelchair riders can live and work in environments that they
can only dream of visiting today. Ralf will show unfinished designs that open
wide opportunities for new developments, and he will make a plea for the
innovative designers of UC Davis to enter into one of today's most fulfilling
areas of invention and international development work.

Biography
=========

Ralf Hotchkiss is an inventor and the lead designer of the Whirlwind Wheelchair
International, a non-profit located in Berkeley. Its mission is "to make it
possible for every person in the developing world who needs a wheelchair to
obtain one that will lead to maximum personal independence and integration into
society". Ralf taught a SFSU class, Engineering 620: Wheelchair Design and
Construction, in which students built a complete wheelchair in a Third World
appropriate shop. Ralf is a graduate of Oberlin College and a `1989 MacArthur
Foundation Fellow <http://www.macfound.org/fellows/365/>`_.
