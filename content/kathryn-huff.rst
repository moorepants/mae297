Nuclear power provides the majority of our nation's safe, reliable, carbon free
energy. Advanced nuclear reactors and nuclear fuel cycles promise to further
improve passive safety, fuel utilization, and environmental impacts of this key
energy source. This seminar will discuss open, reproducible, computational
approaches to modeling and simulation of the multiple coupled physics and
scales inherent to these systems. Approaches will include (1) agent based
modeling of future energy growth, reprocessing, and fuel management scenarios,
(2) the interplay between probabilistic and deterministic neutron transport
methods for design and safety analysis, and (3) development of reactor physics
kernels for the MOOSE (multiphysics object oriented simulation environment)
framework.

Biography
=========

Dr. Kathryn D. Huff is currently an Assistant Professor in the Department of
Nuclear, Plasma, and Radiological Engineering at the University of Illinois at
Urbana-Champaign where she leads the Advanced Reactors and Fuel Cycles Research
Group (arfc.npre.illinois.edu). She holds an affiliate faculty position with
the National Center for Supercomputing Applications and is one of the
University of Illinois' most recent Blue Waters Professors.

She was previously a Postdoctoral Fellow with both the Nuclear Science and
Security Consortium and the Berkeley Institute for Data Science at the
University of California - Berkeley. She received her PhD in Nuclear
Engineering from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in August 2013 and her
undergraduate degree in Physics from the University of Chicago.

Her current research focuses on modeling and simulation of advanced nuclear
reactors and fuel cycles. She is currently the elected chair of the Fuel Cycle
and Waste Management Division of the American Nuclear Society. Through
leadership within the Hacker Within, Software Carpentry, SciPy, the Journal of
Open Source Software, and other initiatives she strives to advocate for best
practices in open, reproducible scientific computing.  With colleagues,
collaborators, and friends, she has co-authored two books to help scientists
with these practices: Effective Computation in Physics, O'Reilly, 2015 and The
Practice of Reproducible Research, UC Press, 2017.
