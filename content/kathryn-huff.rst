Nuclear power provides the majority of our nation's safe, reliable, carbon free 
energy.  Advanced nuclear reactors and nuclear fuel cycles promise to further 
improve passive safety, fuel utilization, and environmental impacts of this key 
energy source. This seminar will discuss open, reproducible, computational 
approaches to modeling and simulation of the multiple coupled physics and 
scales inherent to these systems. Approaches will include (1) agent based 
modeling of future energy growth, reprocessing, and fuel management scenarios, 
(2) the interplay between probabilistic and deterministic neutron transport 
methods for design and safety analysis, and (3) development of reactor physics 
kernels for the MOOSE (multiphysics object oriented simulation environment) 
framework. 


Biography
=========

Dr. Kathryn D. Huff is currently an Assistant Professor in the Department of 
Nuclear, Plasma, and Radiological Engineering at the University of Illinois at 
Urbana-Champaign where she leads the Advanced Reactors and Fuel Cycles Research 
Group (arfc.npre.illinois.edu). She holds an affiliate faculty position with 
the National Center for Supercomputing Applications and is one of the 
University of Illinois' most recent Blue Waters Professors. She was previously 
a Postdoctoral Fellow with both the Nuclear Science and Security Consortium and 
the Berkeley Institute for Data Science at the University of California - 
Berkeley. She received her PhD in Nuclear Engineering from the University of 
Wisconsin-Madison in August 2013 and her undergraduate degree in Physics from 
the University of Chicago.  Her current research focuses on modeling and 
simulation of advanced nuclear reactors and fuel cycles. She is currently the 
elected chair of the Fuel Cycle and Waste Management Division of the American 
Nuclear Society. Through leadership within the Hacker Within, Software 
Carpentry, SciPy, the Journal of Open Source Software, and other initiatives 
she strives to advocate for best practices in open, reproducible scientific 
computing.
