Dick Bourne, founder of the Davis Energy Group, the UC Davis Western Cooling
Efficiency Center, and Integrated Comfort, Inc. will review key experiences in
his life as an inventor, for two purposes: 1) the drawing of lessons useful to
the young and creative; and 2) entertainment. From his inventive start as a
grad student in the Stanford Design Division, where he was also a writer in the
Engineering Case Program, Dick will describe how studying the inventing process
and working with creative designers nurtured his early (but failed) attempt to
support a family as an independent inventor. After reviewing several of his
early inventions- some fanciful and some practical- Dick will describe learning
to use OPM (other peopleâ€™s money) to develop useful designs/inventions that
serve the public interest. Most of the talk will focus on energy efficiency
products for buildings, including innovative solar heating and natural cooling
concepts. In this arena he will briefly summarize six of his patents that have
achieved progress toward commercialization. These will include unique systems
for radiant floor heating, night roof-spray/storage cooling, low-cost solar
heating, two-stage evaporative cooling, dual evaporative pre-cooling for HVAC
units, and geothermal heat exchangers. For each of these, Dick will present the
major rationale, the crux of the design, the alternate paths to the market, and
the key lesson learned.
