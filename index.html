          <h3>High Power Handling Hot-Switching RF-MEMS Switches</h3>
          </a>
          <p>Due to its low insertion loss, high isolation, high linearity, wide bandwidth,
and near-zero dc power consumption, radio frequency micro-electromechanical
(RF-MEMS) switches have been an emerging technology with significant potential
in many high frequency circuits and systems, especially those requiring
reconfiguration. In this talk, we present several RF-MEMS switch designs that
can significantly extend the hot-switching life-time of RF-MEMS contact
switches. To prevent the contact degradation during hot-switching events,
series and/or protection contacts are added in parallel with the &quot;real&quot;
contacts. For unpackaged devices using Au-Au as the &quot;real&quot; contact material and
Pt-Au as the protection contact material, we ...</p>

          <p>Emerging fabrication process for mechanical structures can offer advantages in
terms of reduced energy requirements or increased design flexibility. However,
the body of knowledge lacks the design consideration of such components to
optimize the final part's characteristics. Researchers have established best
practices and design considerations for traditional manufacturing processes to

          <p>Understanding the interactions between robotic systems and the human's complex
musculoskeletal system is a key bottleneck in designing effective assistive
devices. OpenSim is free and open source software for modeling neural and

the software to predict the effects of assistive devices on human performance
in tasks such as load carriage, running, and jumping.  We have discovered that
passive assistive devices have the potential to markedly increase jump

simultaneously optimized human performance and device design. We have also used

          <h3>Structural Coloration of Metallic Surfaces Using Elliptical Vibration
Texturing</h3>
          </a>
          <p>Micro-structured surfaces are assuming an ever-increasing role since they
define the ultimate performance of many industrial components and products.
Surface micro-structures, when carefully designed, can alter the optical,
biological, tribological, and thermal properties of the original surfaces. The
bottleneck of applying this new technology to commercial products is
manufacturing efficiency. This talk demonstrates one example of using a novel
vibration-assisted machining method for fast creation of periodic
micro/nano-gratings for structural coloration. When the tool vibration is
coupled with a constant cutting velocity, periodic cusps can be generated due
to the machining marks. The periodic vibration-induced ripples can be precisely ...</p>

                <h3>Abstract</h3>
                <p>Due to its low insertion loss, high isolation, high linearity, wide bandwidth,
and near-zero dc power consumption, radio frequency micro-electromechanical
(RF-MEMS) switches have been an emerging technology with significant potential
in many high frequency circuits and systems, especially those requiring
reconfiguration. In this talk, we present several RF-MEMS switch designs that
can significantly extend the hot-switching life-time of RF-MEMS contact
switches. To prevent the contact degradation during hot-switching events,
series and/or protection contacts are added in parallel with the &quot;real&quot;
contacts. For unpackaged devices using Au-Au as the &quot;real&quot; contact material and
Pt-Au as the protection contact material, we have demonstrated unprecedented
hot-switching performance of 150-million actuation cycles at 1-W  and
50-million at 2 W.</p>

                <p>Ralf Hotchkiss will track the design of the Whirlwind Wheelchair from its
beginning thirty years ago to the present and on into the future. From the
first design breakthroughs of barefoot blacksmiths to the high tech testing and
manufacturing methods of today, surprise breakthroughs in basic wheelchair
design have come from the backyard inventors of some forty developing
countries. These inventors form the Whirlwind Network of wheelchair riders and
designers. Their goal is not only to make wheelchairs available in the poorest
of countries; it is to radically improve the durability and rough-ground
mobility so that wheelchair riders can live and work in environments that they
can only dream of visiting today. Ralf will show unfinished designs that open
wide opportunities for new developments, and he will make a plea for the
innovative designers of UC Davis to enter into one of today's most fulfilling
areas of invention and international development work.</p>

approaches to modeling and simulation of the multiple coupled physics and
scales inherent to these systems. Approaches will include (1) agent based
modeling of future energy growth, reprocessing, and fuel management scenarios,
(2) the interplay between probabilistic and deterministic neutron transport
methods for design and safety analysis, and (3) development of reactor physics
kernels for the MOOSE (multiphysics object oriented simulation environment)
framework.</p>

                <h3>Abstract</h3>
                <p>Emerging fabrication process for mechanical structures can offer advantages in
terms of reduced energy requirements or increased design flexibility. However,
the body of knowledge lacks the design consideration of such components to
optimize the final part's characteristics. Researchers have established best
practices and design considerations for traditional manufacturing processes to
reduce the product cycle and increase the efficiency and quality of final
components. This talk will discuss the implementation of design-for
manufacturing approach for Origami sheet metal (OSM) folding fabrication
process.</p>
<p>OSM folded structures are promising topological entities that can be folded
from a flat metal sheet to complex 3-dimensional geometrically constrained
structures. It can offer a reduced demand on the manufacturing and design
resources such as energy, heavy machinery, and complex die design. In addition,
the OSM structures can exploit materials with high strength-to-weight ratios
such as aluminum and stainless steel. Despite its potential, there is a lack in
the understanding of the parameters affecting the topological
re-configurability and load bearing capabilities for full scale OSM structures.
Specifically, the folding performance through the thickness of metal materials
with focus on failure mechanism along the fold lines. The technique of
combining folding structures and metal materials poses challenges that require
further investigation. This talk discusses the extension of the Origami
technique to the fold forming of sheet metal products represented in modeling
approach and design considerations for the topological variations, the
geometrical validity, and mechanical performance analysis.</p>

                <p>Dick Bourne, founder of the Davis Energy Group, the UC Davis Western Cooling
Efficiency Center, and Integrated Comfort, Inc. will review key experiences in
his life as an inventor, for two purposes: 1) the drawing of lessons useful to
the young and creative; and 2) entertainment. From his inventive start as a
grad student in the Stanford Design Division, where he was also a writer in the
Engineering Case Program, Dick will describe how studying the inventing process
and working with creative designers nurtured his early (but failed) attempt to
support a family as an independent inventor. After reviewing several of his
early inventions- some fanciful and some practical- Dick will describe learning
to use OPM (other people’s money) to develop useful designs/inventions that
serve the public interest. Most of the talk will focus on energy efficiency
products for buildings, including innovative solar heating and natural cooling
concepts. In this arena he will briefly summarize six of his patents that have
achieved progress toward commercialization. These will include unique systems
for radiant floor heating, night roof-spray/storage cooling, low-cost solar
heating, two-stage evaporative cooling, dual evaporative pre-cooling for HVAC
units, and geothermal heat exchangers. For each of these, Dick will present the
major rationale, the crux of the design, the alternate paths to the market, and
the key lesson learned.</p>

                <h3>Abstract</h3>
                <p>Understanding the interactions between robotic systems and the human's complex
musculoskeletal system is a key bottleneck in designing effective assistive
devices. OpenSim is free and open source software for modeling neural and
musculoskeletal structures and predicting and analyzing movement. We are using
the software to predict the effects of assistive devices on human performance
in tasks such as load carriage, running, and jumping.  We have discovered that
passive assistive devices have the potential to markedly increase jump
performance. These results were generated using a dynamic optimization that
simultaneously optimized human performance and device design. We have also used
simulations to develop a set of design principles for using assistive devices
to reduce the metabolic cost of running and walking with a heavy load. OpenSim
is more than a software package—it has also become a diverse and vibrant
community of researchers, teachers, and clinicians who use the software for a
wide range of applications from improving treatment for children with cerebral
palsy to designing exercises to prevent bone and muscle loss during
spaceflight. This talk will provide an introduction to the OpenSim project and
highlight several research applications where we are using the software to
study human-device interaction and aid assistive device design.</p>

                <h3>Abstract</h3>
                <p>During spaceflight astronauts experience musculoskeletal losses and moderate to
severe lumbar pain. There is also a significant incidence of herniated
intervertebral disc (IVD) in astronauts, especially in the first year after
return to Earth. The pathogenesis of back pain during and after spaceflight is
currently unknown. Our current investigation aims to understand this higher
incidence of herniated IVDs and back pain. Studies incorporate pre- and
post-flight imaging, functional tests, and pain questionnaires of International
Space Station (ISS) crew members to ascertain mechanisms of back pain as well
as degeneration and injury to spinal structures. Presently six out of 12 ISS
crew members have completed all pre- and post-flight testing. Preliminary
results to date document: 1) decreased functional back-muscle extensor test
(Biering-Sørensen test time), 2) decreased cervical and lumbar muscle
functional cross-sectional areas with partial recovery by R+45 (only 21% in
neck), 3) increased spine stiffness in flexion, 4) increased spine
straightening, 5) decreased quality of vertebral bodies (anterior wedging and
endplate irregularities), 6) variable water content changes and 7) no
significant changes to disc height and lumbar length. Our results for
morphological, biochemical, metabolic, and fluoroscopic kinematics of the spine
may aid development of countermeasures to reduce back pain and decrease the
incidence of herniated IVDs post-flight. Countermeasures proposed in-flight
should include integrated cardiovascular and musculoskeletal exercises to
reproduce normal, daily Earth-like stresses. Our long-term objectives are to:
1) promote crew health and well-being inflight, 2) optimize post-flight
rehabilitation and translate our findings for Earth Benefit. Supported by NASA
grants NNX10AM18G and NNX13AM89G.</p>

                <p>As engineering researchers and scholars, we hope to have an impact on the world
through our work. Many of us went into this field in pursuit of the dream of
using our skills and training to help improve the lives of others.
Unfortunately, through the pressures of career advancement we find ourselves
creating and publishing work that will be read by a handful (sometimes fewer)
of others. While practicing open engineering won't guarantee that more people
will read your work, it does remove many of the barriers to access that make it
difficult for millions of people around the world to obtain and engage with the
engineering knowledge that is so often locked away behind the paywalls employed
by some of the biggest academic publishers. With the availability of modern
tools, it is easier than ever to make available not only the final, polished
product of the engineering research or design process, but also the data, code,
solid models, or any other artifacts produced along the way. By making the full
scope of our work available, we have the opportunity to see our work
replicated, expanded upon, or even driven in new directions we hadn't
conceived. Through these mechanisms, the impact of our work is magnified. To
realize these benefits, it may be necessary to re-examine the reward structures
which drive our career advancement and in some cases, restructure the role of
the publicly funded research institution in society.</p>

                <h3>Abstract</h3>
                <p>Micro-structured surfaces are assuming an ever-increasing role since they
define the ultimate performance of many industrial components and products.
Surface micro-structures, when carefully designed, can alter the optical,
biological, tribological, and thermal properties of the original surfaces. The
bottleneck of applying this new technology to commercial products is
manufacturing efficiency. This talk demonstrates one example of using a novel
vibration-assisted machining method for fast creation of periodic
micro/nano-gratings for structural coloration. When the tool vibration is
coupled with a constant cutting velocity, periodic cusps can be generated due
to the machining marks. The periodic vibration-induced ripples can be precisely
controlled in terms of spacing by changing the nominal cutting velocity. These
periodic ripples, whose wavelength is in the visible spectrum, can introduce
iridescent colors. The device design, theoretical analysis, experimental
results, and potential applications of the process will be covered in this talk
to demonstrate structural coloration of metals by direct machining.</p>
